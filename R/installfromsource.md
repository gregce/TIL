# Installing from source

Its only a matter of time before you get the itch to build your own R package! 

Packages are really the best way to share code & analysis in R... so good that Hadley Wickahm has [written the book on them](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/). If you haven't hosted your package on github or cran, this is "need to know" stuff!

Accordingly, this TIL is short and sweet.

### Installing from source

```
install.packages(path_to_file, repos = NULL, type="source")
```
