# Customizing startup options in R studio

Note: this assumes you're running a *nix OS

Start up options can be easily customized in the .Rprofile file. Upon startup, R searches for this file in your current working directory, `getwd()`, or your home directory `/~` for an .Rprofile file.

Customizing this file allows you to customize your startup and exit options. Of course there are a lots of possible Options() values you can set too. I've taken a minimialistic approach to customizing these options.

```
.First <- function(){
 rm(list = ls())
 cat("\nWelcome Greg at", date(), "\n")
}

.Last <- function(){
 cat("\nGoodbye at ", date(), "\n")
}
```
